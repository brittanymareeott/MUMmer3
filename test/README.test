-=- README for MUMmer3.xx testing -=-

Directories 1-3 contain test sets for MUMmer3.xx and the output that
NUCmer and PROmer produce for this input.

reproduce these results by running in each of the <#> directories
nucmer <#>.ref.seq <#>.qry.seq -p testnuc
promer <#>.ref.seq <#>.qry.seq -p testpro
show-coords -r testnuc.delta > testnuc.coords
show-coords -r testpro.delta > testpro.coords

<1> A small 5 vs 5 comparison of two artificially generated contig sets.
    Similar to a assembly mapping use case.

<2> A small 5 vs 23 comparison of two artificially generate contig sets.
    Similar to an unfinished to finished contig mapping use case.

<3> A small 1 vs 4 comparison of sequences only similar on the protein level.
    Used to test the sensitivity of promer.

<BLAST> MUMmer to BLAST performance comparisons, note that each program was
designed for a different purpose, so they are not interchangeable.

For more complete or non-regression testing, uncomment the "#define
_DEBUG_ASSERT" statement in both 'postnuc.cc' and 'postpro.cc' and recompile
these two files. This will cause NUCmer and PROmer to perform self-testing
routines to check for output validity and program correctness. With this
value turned on, NUCmer and PROmer will return a non-zero value on exit if
an error or inconsistency was detected. Try running this on various test sets
with various command line parameters.
