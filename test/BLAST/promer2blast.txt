-=- PROmer to BLAST performance comparison -=-

Input Files
-----------
Reference - 997 KB
Query - 83 KB

These input files are from regions extracted from the P. yoelii and T. parva
genomes that were previously known to show some degree similarity. Both input
files contain more that one sequence.


Parameters
----------
BLAST - standard 'tblastx' parameters were used
PROmer - (-c 10 -d .001 -g 20 -l 3 -m 0)

The PROmer command line parameters were chosen to best mimic the standard
BLAST parameters. Since PROmer is often used just to determine syntenic regions,
its default parameters are much more stringent and less sensitive than BLAST's.


Run Time
--------
BLAST - 24.06 s
PROmer - 11.56 s

As expected PROmer is faster than BLAST, even for this extremely small data
set. Note that the BLAST time does not include the time necessary to generate
the BLAST search database, but for such a small data set the time needed for
this task in negligible.  Also note that PROmer used more memory than BLAST,
how much is not known.
    These results are for a 1.6 GHz, 512 MB Linux desktop computer.


Output
------
BLAST - much more sensitive than PROmer, but many of its matches are false
positives or repeat regions. When a more stringent expect value is set
(say 1e-60), PROmer will demonstrate an equal performance and align the same
regions as BLAST, given that those regions have a high enough percent identity
to facilitate clusters of matches.

PROmer - more conservative at identifying aligned regions. Thus, more accurately
reports syntenic regions and probable conserved genes, especially when more
default-like parameters are chosen. A very small wordsize (like the 3 used here)
somewhat hurts PROmer if a matching program focused on "uniqueness" is used.
Many small matches may be ignored because they are not unique, and therefore
never clustered together and reported as alignments. In addition, when finding
matches, PROmer only considers identities and disregards positive BLOSUM scores,
this may cause it to miss regions of positive BLOSUM score but with few
identical matches.


Below are a few similarities and differences between the output of BLAST and
PROmer. These generally represent all of the major discrepancies between the
two programs.

NOTE: PROmer output has the "Sbjct" sequence on the top and the "Query" sequence
on the bottom, BLAST is reversed.

These are the exact same alignment regions, but the PROmer alignment region
is much longer. This is because 'tblastx' does not allow for gapped alignments,
but PROmer does. Notice the the BLAST alignment terminates at the exact spot
where the is an indel in the PROmer alignment. PROmer almost always give more
expansive alignment regions than BLAST does. Below is the center line for the
PROmer and BLAST output on top of each other, as you can see, the alignment
is exactly the same for the region aligned by BLAST.

As you can see, there is only one exact match that has length >= 3 (LYTN).
Because of this, PROmer will not identify this region because the cluster length
(sum of the matches in the cluster) has to be greater than or equal to 10. In
this instance, a MUM was found, but since there were no other MUMs in its
vicinity, it was not formed into a cluster, and hence, never extended.

This case is a little different, in that there are many exact matches, but each
is seperated by a mismatch. Because there are no matches of length >= 3 in this
region, PROmer did not identify it as an alignment. This BLAST alignment is poor
anyway, and would serve little use in the construction of a genome mapping.
Therefore, PROmer is not losing anything by failing to identify this region.

Since this case contains a somewhat large exact match, it was identified by
PROmer as a hit. But because of the gapped, poorly matching surrounding region,
BLAST did not recognize it (or score it high enough) to be a hit.
